# Osu! Collab Tool
## Tool that _might_ help you in collabs

Osu! Collab Tool is a simple tool that helps in the mapping process of osu!

_Please note that I only made this as a school project, so there can be some bugs here and there since I'm still an intermediate at coding, but you can always report those bugs to me, and I'll fix it as soon as I can!_

# Features
There are in total 8 features in this simple tool!
## The hitsounding tool
-- _Hit  Object hitsounding tool_ : This feature can help highlight a set of hit objects using conditions, and enables you to edit their hitsound property!
-- _Volume Tool_ : This feature will enable you to take care of multiple green/red points at once and edit their volume all at once!
## Mini mapping tool
-- _Pattern Bank_ : Lets you save patterns into a seperate .txt file and use them later on, perhaps on another map!
## Merger Tool
-- _Merger_ : This tool allows you to take two .osu files, and combine them into one! Perhaps it's pretty useful in collabs?
-- _Comparer_ : Did you copy your version so many times that you don't know what are the differences? This tool will help you find those differences.
-- _Seperator_ : The opposite of the _Merger_, this helps you to split a map based on a timestamp you input.
## Song Setup Tool
-- _Map setup tool_ : This tool is just an extra mini tool, that helps you to change the metadata of the file, perhaps in cases when the editor has some problems in displaying the song setup tab, which happends to some PCs.
-- _BPM Detector_ : This is as the name suggests, you can detect the bpm of an audio. And since you can select a specific section of a map, by theory this tool can help you detect multiple BPM in the same song!
